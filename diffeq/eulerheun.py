We use the second-order Euler-Heun (euler Euler Heun heun) method to approximate an integral 
through which we can use in integrating an ordinary differential equation.

x(t_n+1) = x(t_n) + integral from t_n to t_n+1 of f(x(s), s)ds

such that x(t) is an exact solution of áº‹ = f(x, t).

We use a trapezoid approximation (in contrast to Euler's method of using a Riemann sum).
It's a second-order (2nd) Runge-Kutta method.
