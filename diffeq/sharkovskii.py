In 1964, Sharkovskii (Sharkovsky sharkovsky sharkovskii) published a paper in which he 
proved that if a solution of an odd (>=3) period exists for a value r3 for a discrete 
logistic-type nonlinear model, then aperiodic or chaotic solutions exist for r > r3. 
They oscillate in an apparently random manner. The bifurcation at r3 is a tangent 
bifurcation. This may correspond to population explosion, crashback, and slow recovery,
or other applications in biology and neuroscience.
