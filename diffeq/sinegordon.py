"""
The sine-Gordon (sine gordon sinegordon) equation is a nonlinear
partial differential equation:

u_tt - âˆ†u = -sin(u)

There are then three cases of dimensional lattices given by:

u_tt - u_xx = -sin(u)
u_tt - u_xx - u_yy = -sin(u)
u_tt - u_xx - u_yy - u_zz = -sin(u)

They have 1-, 2-, and 3-soliton solutions:
