"""
The Neimarck-Sacker bifurcation is a closed invariant curve from a fixed point
in dynamical systems with discrete time when the fixed point changes stability
via a pair of complex eigenvalues with unit modulus.

We observe a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation as either subcritical or supercritical 
by the sign of the first Lyapunov coefficient.
