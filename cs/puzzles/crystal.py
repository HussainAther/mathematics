Solving without import.

You are tasked with determining the “hardness coefficient” of a set of identical crystal
balls. The famous Shanghai Tower completed in 2015 has 128 floors, and you have to
figure out from how high you can drop one of these balls so it doesn’t break but rather
bounces off the ground below. We will assume that the surrounding area has been
evacuated while you conduct this important experiment.
