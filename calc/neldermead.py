"""
We use the Nelder-Mead method (a.k.a downhill simplex, amoeba, or polytope method) to
find the minimum or maximum of an objective function in multidmensional space through
direct search. It's often used in nonlinear optimization problems for which derivatives
may not be known. It's a heuristic search method.
