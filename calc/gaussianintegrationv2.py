Functions to calculate integration points and weights for Gaussian quadrature.

x,w = gaussxw(N) returns integration points x and integration
#          weights w such that sum_i w[i]*f(x[i]) is the Nth-order
#           Gaussian approximation to the integral int_{-1}^1 f(x) dx
# x,w = gaussxwab(N,a,b) returns integration points and weights
#           mapped to the interval [a,b], so that sum_i w[i]*f(x[i])
#           is the Nth-order Gaussian approximation to the integral
#           int_a^b f(x) dx
#
# This code finds the zeros of the nth Legendre polynomial using
# Newton's method, starting from the approximation given in Abramowitz
# and Stegun 22.16.6.  The Legendre polynomial itself is evaluated
# using the recurrence relation given in Abramowitz and Stegun
# 22.7.10.
