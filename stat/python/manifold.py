"""
Manifold learning is a class of unsupervised estimators that seeks to describe datasets 
as low-dimensional manifolds embedded in high-dimensional spaces. When you think of a 
manifold, I'd suggest imagining a sheet of paper: this is a two-dimensional object that 
lives in our familiar three-dimensional world, and can be bent or rolled in that two 
dimensions. In the parlance of manifold learning, we can think of this sheet as a two-
dimensional manifold embedded in three-dimensional space.
