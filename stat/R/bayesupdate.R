# Bayesian updating of beliefs about the bias of a coin. 
# The prior and posterior distributions indicate probability masses at discrete candidate values of Î¸.
# Theta is the vector of candidate values for the parameter theta.
# nThetaVals is the number of candidate theta values.
# To produce the examples in the book, set nThetaVals to either 3 of 63.
nThetaVals = 3
