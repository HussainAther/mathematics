"We use Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST). Suppose an experimenter plans to collect data based on a two-tier stopping criterion. The experimenter will"
"collect an initial batch of data with N = 30 and then do a NHST. If the result is not significant, then an"
"additional 15 subjectsâ€™ data will be collected, for a total N of 45. Suppose the researcher intends to use the"
"standard critical values for determining significance at both the N = 30 and N = 45 stages. Our goal is determine"
"the actual false-alarm rate for this two-stage procedure, and to ponder what the mere intention of doing a second"
"phase implies for interpreting the first stage, even if data collection stops with the first stage."

N1 = 30 # Number of flips for first test.
N2 = 15 # Number of _additional_ flips for second test.
