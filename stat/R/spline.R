"When smoothing one dimensional data, we want to find an approximation to the true conditional
expectation or reegression function Î¼. We were controlling how smooth we make indirectly through
the bandwith of the kernels, but we can use a more direct method of controlling smoothness itself by
minimizing the spline objective function."
