"Following the coin-flipping examples, suppose we flip the coin a 
total of N = 12 times and it comes up heads in z = 8 of those flips. 
Suppose we let a beta(θ; 100, 1) distribution describe the head-biased 
trick coin, and we let a beta(θ; 1, 100) distribution describe the tail-biased trick coin."
