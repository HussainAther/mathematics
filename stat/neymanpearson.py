Neyman-Pearson Lemma: Let L(theta|x) denote hte likelihood function for the random variable X corresponding to the
probability measure P_theta. If there exists a critical region C of size alpha and a nonnegative constant
k such that

L(theta1|x)/L(theta0|x) >= k for x in region C and L(theta1|x) <= L(theta0|x) for x not in region C,

then C is the most powerful critical region of size alpha.

If a random sample is taken from a distribution with parameter t, a hypothesis is a simple hypothesis
if the hypothesis uniquely specififes the distribution of the population from which the sample is taken.
Any other hypothesis is a composite hypothesis.

The critical region is the region of values that corresponds to the rejection of the null hypothesis at some chosen probability level.
