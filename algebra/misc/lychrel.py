"""
A Lychrel (lychrel) number is a natural number that cannot form a palindrome through the iterative process of 
repeatedly reversing its digits and adding the resulting numbers. 
1. Take an integer n, greater than zero.
2. Form the next n of its series by reversing the digits of the current n and adding the result to the current n.
3. Stop when n becomes palindromic - i.e. the digits of n in reverse order == n.
