"""
Convolution or deconvolution of a real set of data in array form a of two functions s(t) and r(t) (written as s(t) * r(t)).
Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions is equal to the product of their individual Fourier transforms.
(s) is typicall a signal or data stream that goes on indefinitely in time while r(t) is a "response" function that typically
has peaks that fall to zero in both directions from its maximum.
